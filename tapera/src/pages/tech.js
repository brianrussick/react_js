            <h4 id="gard" class="text-5xl text-blue-500 font-semibold mb-2 mt-9">GARD</h4>
            <h4 id="question" class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-9">What is GARD?</h4>
            <p id="text" class="text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-2">GARD is the first truly decentralized dollar. GARD was inspired by
            prominent DeFi projects such as Maker, Staticoin, and TerraLuna, and then built on the superior Algorand blockchain with
            logical improvements along the way. GARD is an algorithmic stable token that is backed by Algorand's blockchain and uses
            Algos as collateral. We incentivize reserve providers by offering them governance rewards and liquidity (GARD), a combination
            that was previously impossible. By doing this we have effectively created a line of credit that pays our users. We incentivize
            use of GARD because of the almost zero transaction fees, decentralization, and stability.</p>
            
            <h4 id="question2" class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-9">Why is GARD needed?</h4>
            <p id="text" class="text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-2">The need for stabletokens has been demonstrated by the astronomical rise in
            the overall stabletoken market cap to over $100 billion. For those that desire stability and the benefits of blockchain it's
            essential that there are tokens that fulfill their needs, however, traditional stabletokens maintain their value by having collateral
            in the form of highly regulated financial instruments which is counterproductive to DeFi. While there have been improvements since the
            first stabletokens most have been built on blockchains that are inferior to Algorand, they have worse tokenomics, and none are truly
            decentralized as a product of both their infrastructure and tokenomics. GARD solves these problems.</p>
            
            <h4 id="question3" class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-9">How does GARD fit into our mission?</h4>
            <p id="text" class="text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-2">GARD will enable Tapera and other users to cut through red tape and gain access to
            life changing DeFi resources. Whether one is a liquidity provider, or simply a user they will benefit from using GARD thanks to the
            almost non-existent fees charged by Algorand and the net-zero developer fees we have implemented into the protocol. This new decentralized
            dollar will increase access for all.</p>

            <h4 id="question4" class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-9">What milestones have been realized by GARD?</h4>
            <p id="text" class="text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-2">GARD is currently in its alpha stage and is live on the Algorand testnet with proprietary
            Oracles keeping it running.</p>

            <h4 id="wallet" class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-9">Hardware Wallet</h4>
            <p id="text" class="text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-9">We are developing a cheap and portable crypto wallet solution that will keep account
            information offline but easily accessible. We are developing it in tandem with a wallet application that will be web accessible and 
            increase both portability and security for Algorand transactions. Stay tuned for more developments!</p>
