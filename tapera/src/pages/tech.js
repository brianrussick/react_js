            <h4 id="gard" class="text-5xl text-blue-500 font-semibold mb-2 mt-9">GARD</h4>
            <h4 id="question" class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-9">What is GARD?</h4>
            <p id="text" class="text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-2">
            GARD is an algorithmic stable token backed by a smart contract structure that is analogous
            to a collateralized debt position (CDP). This smart contract is similar to a CDP in that it
            issues a line of credit from collateral; however, it is revolutionary because this collateral
            will actually be put into Algorand’s Governance system, which earns network rewards risk-free
            by processing transactions.</p>

            <h4 id="question2" class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-9">Why is GARD needed?</h4>
            <p id="text" class="text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-2">
            We have created the first truly decentralized dollar. What separates our stablecoin is:
            Our choice of blockchain, our proprietary code/how we plan to govern it, and our source of liquidity - Algos.</p>

            <p id="text" class="text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-6">
            Our choice of blockchain is important because while many other blockchains have been rushed to
            market with enormous VC budgets for promotion, the logical choice for longterm crypto solutions
            is Algorand. It is the only major blockchain that has been developed scientifically and it was
            made by the leading mind in cryptography, Silvio Micali, an MIT professor.</p>
            
            <p id="text" class="text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-6">
            Another feature of GARD is the unique tokenomics structure we have created. We incentivize reserve
            providers by paying them network rewards and giving them liquidity from their locked tokens. We
            incentivize use of GARD by charging nearly zero transaction fees and maintaining its peg.</p>

            <p id="text" class="text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-6">
            Sourcing liquidity directly from Algos, rather than creating our own separate store of value or
            balancing token, solves many issues. First, Algorand is highly liquid, which provides more protection
            from market manipulation than a token of our own creation. Second, Algorand has utility on its own and
            thus has intrinsic value unlike tokens on other blockchains. Finally, because the system uses arbitrage
            and market selling, there is no need for a balancing token or seigniorage process,which prevents the
            occurrence of a black swan event.</p>

            <p id="text" class="text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-6">
            By improving ideas from the few algorithmic stabletoken projects such as Maker ($7 billion USD issued),
            Staticoin (no traction), and TerraLuna ($10 billion USD issued), and then building on the superior Algorand
            blockchain, we have created the logical solution for those seeking the most utility and least risk from their capital.</p>


            
            
            <h4 id="question3" class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-9">Who is your target market?</h4>
            <p id="text" class="text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-2">
            Our initial market will be current Algorand holders, stakers, and DeFi participants. The Algorand market capitalization is
            more than $10 billion and ~50% of tokens are currently online and participate in validating transactions (earning the fees
            as a result). There also are almost 50,000 Algorand accounts that hold at least 1,000 tokens; we anticipate many of these 
            account holders will desire to participate in the governance update. And, there is a rapidly growing DeFi community within
            Algorand as the blockchain’s utility has begun to be more fully understood. One DeFi project on Algorand has already amassed
            $125 million in staked tokens and they have only existed a year.</p>

            <p id="text" class="text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-6">
            Once we have gained some traction, we imagine our market will grow substantially and create a positive network effect for the
            overall Algorand community. The overall stable token market capitalization is over $100 billion and there are tens of billions
            in algorithmic tokens primarily composed of Maker’s Dai and Luna’s Terra. We are in an exciting overall niche as crypto, stable
            tokens, and DeFi are all receiving significant interest and there is a massive community looking for new projects to adopt.</p>

            <h4 id="question4" class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-9">What milestones have been realized by GARD?</h4>
            <p id="text" class="text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-2">GARD is currently in its alpha stage and is live on the Algorand testnet with proprietary
            Oracles keeping it running.</p>

            <h4 id="wallet" class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-9">Hardware Wallet</h4>
            <p id="text" class="text-2xl text-gray-800 mt-9">We are developing a cheap and portable crypto wallet solution that will keep account
            information offline but easily accessible. We are developing it in tandem with a wallet application that will be web accessible and 
            increase both portability and security for Algorand transactions. Stay tuned for more developments!</p>
