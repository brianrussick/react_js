            those that have smartphones and spend it at normal point of sale systems
            or withdraw it from any ATM. Tapera does all of this using blockchain
            technology with transaction times that are less than one second and cost
            us less than one percent of the amount sent to process.</p>

            Tapera's target customers are those that don't have access to  
            smartphones (15% of US and 55% worldwide), people that don't have
            access to traditional banking services (3-4% of US household and 56% of
            adults worldwide), and those that are early adopters and wish to use a
            new anonymous form of cash.</p>
